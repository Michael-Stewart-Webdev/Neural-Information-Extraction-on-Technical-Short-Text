# Neural Information Extraction on Technical Short Text: From Theory to Practical Systems
A collection of software and demos for my thesis entitled "Neural Information on Technical Short Text: From Theory to Practical Systems".

### Chapter 3: E2EET: From Mention-level to End-to-End Entity Typing

The **E2EET** model described in the chapter is available at https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/e2e-entity-typing. The repository also includes the three datasets (Modified BBN, Modified Ontonotes, and Wiki_50k) described in the chapter.

### Chapter 4: Domain-independent Knowledge Graph Construction

The **Seq2KG** system is available here: https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/Seq2KG. The repository also includes the three  datasets (CateringServices, AutomotiveEngineering, and BBN) described in the chapter.

### Chapter 5: Lexical Normalisation

The **Targeted model** is available at https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/lexnorm.
The **General model** is available at https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/pytorch-lexnorm.
The **US Accidents dataset** is available at https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/us-accidents-dataset.

### Chapter 6: Aquila: An Interactive Web-based Toolset for Knowledge Discovery from Short Text

Aquila is available at https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/aquila.
A live demo of Aquila is currently running at https://nlp-tlp.org/aquila.

### Chapter 7: Redcoat: A Collaborative Annotation Tool for Hierarchical Entity Typing
